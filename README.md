## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify the breed of a dog based on its image. Dog breed classification is a common problem in computer vision, and it has practical applications in areas such as animal shelters, veterinary practices, and for dog enthusiasts. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of dogs labeled with their corresponding breed. This dataset is publicly available and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification). It contains images of 120 breeds of dogs.

## Model Architecture

The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The architecture was designed to efficiently capture the features of dog images and classify them into their respective breeds. The model was trained using transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3, which are commonly used for image classification tasks.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Results

The model achieves a significant accuracy in classifying dog breeds. The performance can be improved further by fine-tuning the model, using data augmentation, or experimenting with different architectures.
